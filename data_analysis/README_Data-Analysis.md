## Data Analysis

Consists of scripts used to analyze and visualize output generated from the scripts and workflows described in the "data_collection" directory.

- (ABRicate_ARG_analysis.R): Analysis and visualization of raw output of extracted antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from "ABRicate_Pell.py" including
  a heatmap of ARGs identified across all genomes
- (ABRicate_virulence_analysis.R): Analysis and visualization of raw output of extracted virulence genes from "ABRicate_Pell.py" including
  Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or virulence gene profiles and heatmap of virulence genes identified across all genomes
- (Snippy_mutation_analysis.R): Analysis and visualization of raw output generated from "Snippy_Pell.py" including plots summarizing mutations identified
  across isolates, genes, and other characteristics, as well as assessment of evolutionary selection across genes and isolate sequence types
